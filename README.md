Monitoring my progress on the [66 Days of Data](https://www.kennethjee.com/66daysofdata).


After attending the [Kaggle 30 Days of ML](https://www.kaggle.com/thirty-days-of-ml), it is good to keep the pace in order to fix the knowldge acquired and to develop the right habits in order to be a good data analyst/scientist.


This repo has been set up to post daily activities done in that regard. You can also join this learning opportunity and also [Join the Discord Server!](https://discord.com/invite/BRv6YGb). It is also meant to be a self-learning ressource for **Machine Learning for Beginners/Intermediates**. 
If you are a total beginner, I would refer you to [the section below ðŸ‘‡](#an-initiation-to-ml), the section on [33 Days of Parallel reading](#33-days-of-parallel-reading).

In this parallel reading, I provide some material for beginners into `Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence`. Somehow, I am sharing my journey into the world of `Data Analysis` with a daily report of the concepts I learn and the activities I do. 

I assume that the readers are familiar with the basics of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. If this is not the case, kidly refer to this extensive [AIMS Python's documentation](https://python.aims.ac.za/) which is a material I have prepared with some colleagues.
