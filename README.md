Monitoring my progress on the [66 Days of Data](https://www.kennethjee.com/66daysofdata).


After attending the [Kaggle 30 Days of ML](https://www.kaggle.com/thirty-days-of-ml), it is good to keep the pace in order to fix the knowldge acquired and to develop the right habits in order to be a good data analyst/scientist.


This repo has been set up to post daily activities done in that regard. You can also join this learning opportunity and also [Join the Discord Server!](https://discord.com/invite/BRv6YGb). It is also meant to be a self-learning ressource for **Machine Learning for Beginners/Intermediates**.
